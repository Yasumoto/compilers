class ([identifier]) //this identifier could be "EmptyTypeDenoter" if it's not there!

the var keyword will give you issues. you can eleminiate it by checking for everything else, and "else" it will be a variable and parse that.

ParentClass

(ObjectTypeDenoter which is similar to emptytypedenoter. but in this case everything will inherit from "Object". 
later on (contextual analysis) we'll have the base (or root) class, known as object. it'll be a predefined thingy, put into the symbol table.


make sure to add class to parseDeclaration (add parseClassDeclaration + token (class) in parseDeclaration)
